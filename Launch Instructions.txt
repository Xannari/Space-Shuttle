Using the pre built shuttle:

fire the first stage at 100% (3 man engines)
Fire second stage (boosters)
rotate anti clockwise 90 degrees so the top side of the shuttle is pointing east, the fuel tank west.

pitch eastward slowly, no more than 45 degrees this will place the shuttle un an 'upside down' position

jettison empty boosters, continue to orbit. may require pitching to 90 degrees

flip around to face topside up (like a  normal aircraft) and jettison main tank

finalise orbit using oms engines
